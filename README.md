# food-ordering-app
This application tries to simulate a ordering application of a restaurant where you can choose multiple choices from its menu and after that <br>
you can pay and get the food delivered to your house.

This application is a practice app that I have done following an onlline course of React made by Academind. <br>
<br>
We can see that we have managed different form validation for the input from the cart component and we have used different react hooks.
Also the data is gotten from an online database, in out case is Firebase and is from where we fetch the data.

<br>
In order to deploy the application: <br>
-Download the project and import it to your code editor <br>
-In the terminal, run: npm install <br>
-To run the application: npm start <br>
<br>
Thank you!
